  //Create an object constructor function that represents a movie. The object should have ratings property that
  //is an array of the rating numbers, and avgRating that should be average of the items in the array. The object
  //should have a method addRating that adds rating to the array and also updates the averageRating.


  // Assuming object is already defined above, one should be able to do the following:
  let movie = new Movie("The Lego Movie"); // Create the object
  console.log("The title is: " + movie.title); // Output the movie title;
  console.log("The average is: " + movie.avgRating); // Output the current average rating. Should be 0.
  movie.addRating(10); // This movie is awesome, let's give it 10 stars.
  console.log("The average is: " + movie.avgRating); // Output the current average rating.
  movie.addRating(6); // Not everybody liked it :(
  console.log("The average is: " + movie.avgRating); // Should be 8.
  console.log("The average is: " + movie.ratings); // Should output Array [10, 6]
