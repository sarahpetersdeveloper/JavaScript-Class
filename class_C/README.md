Homework
========
1. (7 pts) Using jQuery activate corresponding tab and panel when tab is clicked.
2. (17 pts) Remove jQuery reference from index.html. Create myjquery.js file and reference it instead.
Define own set of functions in there that will be drop-in replacement for the used functions above, so that the code that you made for the assignments works still.

P.S. Save assignments and homework as separate files and push to your fork.
